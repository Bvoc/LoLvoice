# General
LoLvoice can convert what you speak into your microphone to text into League of Legend's in-game chat. But, its usage is restricted to in-game and it is not recommended to use LoLvoice in other places such as when using LoL's friend system to chat.

# Usage
The first time you use LoLvoice, it will prompt you to enter the path of LoLvoice folder. You can simply leave it at the default path and press "Set Path".

Then, you should see a screen that allows you to choose modes. LoLvoice have three modes: Sphinx, IBM_STT, and Overdrive. I shall proceed to describe each one in detail.

### Sphinx
Sphinx mode uses the pocketsphinx decoder to translate your speech to text. Its accuracy varies from person to person so it is recommended for you to give it a try before using any other modes. Unlike the other two modes, Sphinx mode works right out of the box. To configure the settings, click the gear icon. There, you can change the keybind -- press the keybind and the program will record your speech from your microphone, and on release of the keybind "type" into League of Legend's in-game chat what you spoke (the exact wording may vary from a little to a lot). So, just plug in a microphone press "Start", get in-game, and enjoy the voice chat function.

### IBM-STT
