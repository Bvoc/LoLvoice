2. Sign in here: [signin](https://idaas.iam.ibm.com/idaas/mtfim/sps/authsvc?PolicyId=urn:ibm:security:authentication:asf:basicldapuser). You should be automatically taken to a page describing IBM's speech to text API.

3. The "Create" button on the lower right hand side will initially be unclickable. Once it configures itself, you will be able to. So, press "Create".

4. It should then take you to your Dashboard. If not, simply click the logo "IBM Cloud" located at the upper left.

5. Under "Cloud Foundry Services", you should see "Speech to Text". Click on it.

6. Click "Show" and copy the username and password (without the quotation marks) into LoLvoice, IBM-STT mode settings. Remember to press "Confirm".

For users whose url is not "https://stream.watsonplatform.net/speech-to-text/api", please send me a message at https://www.reddit.com/user/impeccableaslan. LoLvoice may not work for you if your url is different but this can be easily fixed.

For users who are unaware, the settings for LoLvoice IBM-STT mode can be accessed by clicking on the gear icon after selecting IBM-STT mode.
