# Installation from source
Since LoLvoice is coded in Microsoft's visual studio 2015, the VS' Solution is provided to install with. But, there are a few dependencies required to build LoLvoice:
1. [sphinxbase](https://github.com/cmusphinx/sphinxbase)
2. [pocketsphinx](https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx)
3. [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl)

Other non-library dependencies used are [IBM's Watson Speech-to-Text API](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/speech-to-text/) and a few artworks from [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com/en) for League of Legends. Any licenses or credits for these dependencies can be found at [Licenses-Credits](https://github.com/impeccableaslan/LoLvoice/tree/master/Licenses-Credits).

Once you built those three dependencies, you will have to run your "Developer command prompt for VS" as administrator and create the paths to those dependencies in your system environmental variables:
1. Enter the following commands into the developer command prompt one by one (take care to change the paths)
```
setx -m SPHINX_BASE PATH-TO-SPHINXBASE
setx -m POCK_SPHINX PATH-TO-POCKETSPHINX
setx -m CURL_PATH PATH-TO-CURL
```
2. Then, build the solution with "Debug" configuration.
